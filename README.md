# Progetto-API-2022

Project of Algorithms and Data Structures.

## General info

The aim of this project is to write a code in C which recreate a game similar to [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) playable from terminal with no gui.

## Data structure

To realise the program I used a variation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) where every node is linked to another node generating a dinamic array inside the tree. In this way I can find in O(logn) every element with a general search, at the same time I can keep the array ordered in O(1) time and print the elements in the same time.
